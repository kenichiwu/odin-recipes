    <h2>A Kitsune Udon Bowl filled with thick wheat noodles and broth that is very umami and slightly fishy with subtle notes of seaweed.</h2>
    <p>The noodles are springy and work perfectly with this dish! The aburaage is soft and easy to eat, and contributes a lot of the dish's overall flavor. This can be served with fish cakes as well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dashi</h4>
    <ul>    
        <li>1 ounce kombu (Japanese dried kelp)</li>
        <li>5 cups cold water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup bonito flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Kitsune Udon</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces aburaage (frozen, defrosted fried tofu cakes)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound frozen udon noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Break kombu into 2-inch pieces; this should equal about 2 cups, loosely packed. Bring water and kombu to a gentle boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat; boil for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, then remove and discard kombu. Sprinkle in bonito flakes and bring to a simmer over medium heat, about 2 minutes. Once simmering, remove from heat, strain, and discard solids. Place dashi back into the saucepan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place aburaage in a medium bowl. Cover with hot water and let soak until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Strain, allow to cool briefly until cool enough to handle, and gently press aburaage with your hands to squeeze out any excess water.</li>
        <li>Bring 1 cup dashi, 1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon mirin, and sugar to a boil in another medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat and add the soaked aburaage. Cook, covered, until the majority of the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Flip aburaage halfway through.</li>
        <li>Bring the remaining 4 cups of dashi to a gentle boil over medium heat. Stir in salt, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and remaining 1 tablespoon mirin. Add frozen udon noodles; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until noodles have separated and are tender yet firm to the bite, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide noodles and broth evenly into 2 bowls. Top with seasoned aburaage and sliced scallions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook's Notes</h4>
    <p>Aburaage is deep fried tofu pouches made from soybeans. The cooking process it goes through in this recipe turned it into inariage. You can use 2 ounces of fried bean curd instead.</p>
    <P>Traditional dashi is made with kombu and bonito flakes. It can also be made with dashi tea packets steeped in hot water.</P>
