    <h2>A Kitsune Udon Bowl filled with thick wheat noodles and broth that is very umami and slightly fishy with subtle notes of seaweed.</h2>
    <p>The noodles are springy and work perfectly with this dish! The aburaage is soft and easy to eat, and contributes a lot of the dish's overall flavor. This can be served with fish cakes as well.</p>
