    <p>Tonkatsu is a Japanese version of deep-fried pork chops with a special tangy sauce. Though the air fryer will never duplicate a true deep-fried taste, the appliance is fast, cleanup is a breeze, and there is no used oil to store. Tonkatsu is usually served with raw cabbage, but use this handy air fryer technique, call it "fried pork chops", and serve with your family favorites. I won't tell them it's Japanese, if you don't!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients for Tonkatsu</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>

            <li>Dip each pork chop into the egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl, then turn chops in panko crumbs. Cover the top of the chop with crumbs and press down to encourage them to stick. Place coated chops on the prepared parchment or waxed paper. Repeat until all chops are coated with panko crumbs on both sides.</li>
